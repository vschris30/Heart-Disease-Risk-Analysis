❤️ Heart Disease Risk Prediction using Machine Learning
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the risk of heart disease based on patient health data.
It demonstrates how data science can support healthcare by improving early risk detection.

📁 Dataset
The dataset includes patient features such as age, sex, cholesterol, resting blood pressure, and more, along with a target label indicating heart disease presence.

🧠 Techniques Used
Data Cleaning & Visualization (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)

Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN — scikit-learn)

Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)

📊 Key Insights
Identified key health indicators correlated with heart disease risk

Achieved strong predictive performance across multiple classification models

Visualized data patterns and feature importance to enhance interpretability
